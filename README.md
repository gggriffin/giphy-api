Using the Giphy API, this application takes in user requests for SNES games and generates relevant gifs. As the user types in a new game, a button with their request title is generated. This button will be used to submit requests to the API.

Once pressed, the app submits and API request to Giphy, parses the response and creates 10 gifs for the user. These gifs are static until the user clicks on them. Clicking an animated gif will return it to its static state.
